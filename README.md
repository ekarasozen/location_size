README file for landslide location and size estimation codes. 

These codes are described in Karasozen & West (submitted in 2023), Toward the rapid assessment of potential tsunamigenic landslides. 

This folder contains 3 landslide examples and each example includes: 

1. a control script, rungdrid.py
2. an output folder that contains results in obspy, numpy and pandas format, 
3. a figures folder.  

When rungrid.py is executed following scripts are run:

1. functions script, grid_seach_functions.py, that stores core scripts that prepare waveforms, create the grid and solve for location and size.  
2. plotting script, plot_functions.py, that includes necessary plotting codes. 

The code is not optimized for speed. 

Latest version: 12 January 2023.
